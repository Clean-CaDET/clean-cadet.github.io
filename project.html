            <b>Abstract</b>: Many different code snippets can implement the same software feature. However, a significant subset of these possible solutions contains difficult-to-understand code that harms the software’s maintainability and evolution. Such low-quality code snippets directly harm profit, as frequent and fast code change enables businesses to seize new opportunities. Unfortunately, they are also prevalent in an industry that consists mostly of junior programmers.<br>We developed a platform called Clean CaDET to tackle the prevalence of low-quality code from two angles. The Smell Detector module presents a framework for integrating AI-based code quality assessment algorithms to identify low-quality code as the programmer is writing it. The Smart Tutor module hosts a catalog of educational content that helps the programmer understand the identified issue and suggests possible solutions. By combining the quality assessment with the educational aspect, our integrated solution presents a novel approach for increasing the quality of code produced by our industry.

            <b>Abstract</b>: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has severely crippled our globalized society. Despite the chaos, much of our civilization continued to function, thanks to contemporary information and communication technologies. In education, this situation required instructors and students to abandon the traditional face‐to‐face lectures and move to a fully online learning environment. Such a transition is challenging, both for the teacher tasked with creating digital educational content, and the student who needs to study in a new and isolated working environment. As educators, we have experienced these challenges when migrating our university courses to an online environment. Through this paper, we look to assist educators with building and running an online course. Before we needed to transition online, we researched and followed the best practices to establish various digital educational elements in our online classroom. We present these elements, along with guidance regarding their development and use. Next, we designed an empirical study consisting of two surveys, focus group discussions, and observations to understand the factors that influenced students' engagement with our online classroom. We used the same study to evaluate students' perceptions regarding our digital educational elements. We report the findings and define a set of recommendations from these results to help educators motivate their students and develop engaging digital educational content. Although our research is motivated by the pandemic, our findings and contributions are useful to all educators looking to establish some form of online learning. This includes developers of massive open online courses and teachers promoting blended learning in their classrooms.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are structures in code that indicate the presence of maintainability issues. A significant problem with code smells is their ambiguity. They are challenging to define, and software engineers have a different understanding of what a code smell is and which code suffers from code smells.
<br>A solution to this problem could be an AI digital assistant that understands code smells and can detect and even resolve them. However, it is challenging to develop such an assistant as there are few usable datasets of code smells on which to train and evaluate it. Furthermore, the existing datasets suffer from issues that mainly arise from an unsystematic approach used for their construction.
<br>Through this work, we address this issue by developing a procedure for the systematic manual annotation of code smells. We use this procedure to build a dataset of code smells. During this process, we refine the procedure and identify recommendations and risks for its use. The primary contribution is the proposed annotation model and procedure and the annotators’ experience report. The dataset and supporting tool are secondary contributions of our study. Notably, our dataset includes open-source projects written in the C# programming language, while almost all manually annotated datasets contain projects written in Java.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are structures in code that often have a negative impact on its quality. Manually detecting code smells is challenging and researchers proposed many automatic code smell detectors. Most of the studies propose detectors based on code metrics and heuristics. However, these studies have several limitations, including evaluating the detectors using small-scale case studies and an inconsistent experimental setting. Furthermore, heuristic-based detectors suffer from limitations that hinder their adoption in practice. Thus, researchers have recently started experimenting with machine learning (ML) based code smell detection. 
<br>This paper compares the performance of multiple ML-based code smell detection models against multiple traditionally employed metric-based heuristics for detection of God Class and Long Method code smells. We evaluate the effectiveness of different source code representations for machine learning: traditionally used code metrics and code embeddings (code2vec, code2seq, and CuBERT).
<br>We perform our experiments on the large-scale, manually labeled MLCQ dataset. We consider the binary classification problem – we classify the code samples as smelly or non-smelly and use the F1-measure of the minority (smell) class as a measure of performance. In our experiments, the ML classifier trained using CuBERT source code embeddings achieved the best performance for both God Class (F-measure of 0.53) and Long Method detection (F-measure of 0.75). With the help of a domain expert, we perform the error analysis to discuss the advantages of the CuBERT approach.
<br>This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained neural source code embeddings for code smell detection to the best of our knowledge. A secondary contribution of our study is the systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of multiple heuristic-based approaches on the same large-scale, manually labeled MLCQ dataset.

            <b>Abstract</b>: High-quality code enables sustainable software development, which is a prerequisite of a healthy digital society. To train software engineers to write higher-quality code, we developed an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) grounded in recent advances in ITS design. Its hallmark feature is the refactoring challenge subsystem, which enables engineers to develop procedural knowledge for analyzing code quality and improving it through refactoring. We conducted a focus group discussion with five working software engineers to get feedback for our system. We further conducted a controlled experiment with 51 software engineering learners, where we compared learning outcomes from using our ITS with educational pages offered by a learning management system. We examined the correctness of knowledge, level of knowledge retention after one week, and the learners’ perceived engagement. We found no statistically significant difference between the two groups, establishing that our system does not lead to worse learning outcomes. Additionally, instructors can analyze challenge submissions to identify common incorrect coding patterns and unexpected correct solutions to improve the challenges and related hints. We discuss how our instructors benefited from the challenge subsystem, shed light on the need for a specialized ITS design grounded in contemporary theory, and examine the broader educational potential.

            <b>Abstract</b>: To improve instruction, educators require greater visibility into the learning gains of individual students and the ability to adapt to resolve any learning gaps. A prerequisite to achieving such instruction is decomposing knowledge into small components that function as gradual steps for the learner’s journey. However, decomposing a knowledge domain is not trivial, as instructors must overcome many practical challenges along the way.
<br>We report on our experience of knowledge component modeling for the clean code analysis and refactoring domain. We describe our method and list four challenges encountered during modeling and our solution for them. The resulting knowledge component inventory is a secondary contribution of the paper. These results can assist educators in planning and executing knowledge component modeling to refine their instruction and produce more significant learning gains in their students.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Maintainability determines the ease of analyzing, modifying, reusing, and testing a software component. This quality aspect greatly affects the software’s lifetime cost, contributing to developer productivity and other quality aspects like reliability and performance. Consequently, academia and the industry emphasize the need to train software engineers to build maintainable software code. Unfortunately, code maintainability is an ill-defined domain from a knowledge and skill model perspective. It is challenging to teach and learn. This problem is aggravated by a lack of capable instructors in the field. Existing instructors rely on scalable one-size-fits-all teaching methods that are ineffective.Advances in e-learning technologies can alleviate these issues. This paper’s primary contribution is a conceptual model and implementation of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) specialized in clean code analysis and refactoring. It includes specialized learning instruments for developing procedural knowledge for the refactoring domain. We designed, developed, and evaluated the ITS over two years of working with undergraduate students using a mixed-method approach anchored in design science. We report on the results from the empirical evaluation that showcase the utility of our contributions. The results of this study are helpful for software engineering instructors, including university professors, MOOC designers, and corporate training program trainers.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are poorly designed parts of code whose removal is essential for sustainable software development. However, recognizing code smells in practice is challenging. Machine Learning (ML)-based code smell detectors could solve this problem. Current ML-based code smell detection approaches are based on supervised learning (SL) that requires a large and diverse dataset for training. Unfortunately, the existing code smell datasets are small, which hinders the performance of the trained SL models. This paper aims to improve the performance of ML-based code smell detectors by employing semi-supervised learning (SSL). SSL models are trained by combining a manually labeled code smell dataset with unlabeled code snippets collected from open-source repositories. Two major SSL techniques are employed: self-training and co-training. Experiments were performed for two code smell types: God Class and Long Method. SSL classifiers significantly outperformed SL classifiers for God Class detection (by 6% F-measure). For Long Method detection, SSL classifiers slightly outperformed SL classifiers (by 1% F-measure). This paper is the first to consider applying SSL for code smell detection. SSL models outperforming SL models in all experiments suggest that SSL holds the great potential to improve current code smell detectors, which is essential for their adoption in practice.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells indicate suboptimal design or implementation choices in the source code. They often lead it to be more change- and fault-prone. Recently, the automation of code smell recognition has gained much attention. We conduct a systematic literature review to summarize the information and conclusions published in the period from 1.1.2018. until 1.2.2022. A total of 56 papers passed the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found God Class, Feature Envy, Long Method, and Data Class to be the most detected code smells. Feature engineering methods are most often used, although we can notice that other methods also gain importance over time. Structural metrics are mainly used for the recognition of code smells. The cross-validation metric is commonly used for model validation, and for performance, Recall, precision, and f-measure are most frequently used. Authors tend to create their own data sets for model training. We noticed that only a small group of code smells are commonly detected, and it is necessary to pay attention to the recognition of others. In addition to binary recognition, recognizing the severity of code smells to prioritize the code that needs refactoring should be brought into focus. It is necessary to use other metrics to recognize code smells, such as source code embedding, and text embedding, because structural metrics cannot convey semantics. Systematizing data sets and creating high-quality publicly available data sets would enable the training of code smell recognition models.

        		<b>Abstract</b>: Developing collaborative skills in students is nontrivial. The fact that students work in teams does not mean they become skilled in teamwork. Students face varied challenges when working in teams that harm their skill development and attitude towards teamwork. To prepare students for the collaboration-intensive workplace, we researched and designed a catalog of challenges present in the teamwork of undergraduate software engineering students on 3-month projects. We created an initial catalog of 10 challenges by examining the literature, surveying 15 teaching assistants, and coding their opinions regarding the problems faced by student teams. Using the catalog, we crafted a survey for students nearing the end of their team project to assess which challenges were present in their teamwork. We surveyed students from multiple contexts, including teams of 3, teams of 4, and teams of16 students. We analyzed 155 answers to determine the prevalence and intensity of the 10 challenges in student teams. We discuss our findings and best practices for resolving the most prevalent challenges. The catalog and recommendations are directly valuable for software engineering educators and can inform the broader community of collaborative learning researchers and instructional designers.

        		<b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are structures in code that imply potential maintainability problems and may negatively impact software quality. One of the critical challenges with code smells is that their definitions are often vague, difficult to comprehend and subjective, making them hard to reliably and consistently detect and analyze by humans and automated systems. Most existing code smell detection approaches rely heavily on human interpretation and are typically supported by structural code metrics. Unfortunately, many of these approaches are incomplete and do not cover a range of code properties that could indicate potential code smells.This paper analyzes code smell detection approaches to identify code properties used for code smell detection and analysis. Informed by our previous work and the literature, we define five code properties used by humans and automatic detectors to identify code smells. We demonstrate how various code properties can be mapped to the 22 code smells defined by Martin Fowler. The resulting catalog of properties can help software engineers and code maintainability researchers analyze code smells and build automated code smell detectors that examine properties beyond the traditional structural metrics.

        		<b>Abstract</b>: As many industries are in high demand for Machine Learning (ML) practitioners to solve business problems, it is essential to ensure that students know how to select adequate ML tools for given contexts and apply them ade-quately. To this aim, we designed a project-based undergraduate university ML course. The course utilizes a blended approach, in which students collaborative-ly work on real-world projects using an autograding platform for code-based as-signments specially developed for the needs of the course. The course includes traditional lectures, discussions, reporting, and oral presentations. The course was evaluated using class assessment outcomes, faculty surveys, and observa-tions. The results indicated that the blended learning approach was well-received and helped students better understand how to apply ML tools. They al-so suggest that project-based learning, in combination with an autograding plat-form and a blended approach, can be an effective way to teach undergraduate ML.
