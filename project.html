            <b>Abstract</b>: Many different code snippets can implement the same software feature. However, a significant subset of these possible solutions contains difficult-to-understand code that harms the software’s maintainability and evolution. Such low-quality code snippets directly harm profit, as frequent and fast code change enables businesses to seize new opportunities. Unfortunately, they are also prevalent in an industry that consists mostly of junior programmers.<br>We developed a platform called Clean CaDET to tackle the prevalence of low-quality code from two angles. The Smell Detector module presents a framework for integrating AI-based code quality assessment algorithms to identify low-quality code as the programmer is writing it. The Smart Tutor module hosts a catalog of educational content that helps the programmer understand the identified issue and suggests possible solutions. By combining the quality assessment with the educational aspect, our integrated solution presents a novel approach for increasing the quality of code produced by our industry.

            The challenges of migrating an active learning classroom online in a crisis

            <b>Abstract</b>: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has severely crippled our globalized society. Despite the chaos, much of our civilization continued to function, thanks to contemporary information and communication technologies. In education, this situation required instructors and students to abandon the traditional face‐to‐face lectures and move to a fully online learning environment. Such a transition is challenging, both for the teacher tasked with creating digital educational content, and the student who needs to study in a new and isolated working environment. As educators, we have experienced these challenges when migrating our university courses to an online environment. Through this paper, we look to assist educators with building and running an online course. Before we needed to transition online, we researched and followed the best practices to establish various digital educational elements in our online classroom. We present these elements, along with guidance regarding their development and use. Next, we designed an empirical study consisting of two surveys, focus group discussions, and observations to understand the factors that influenced students' engagement with our online classroom. We used the same study to evaluate students' perceptions regarding our digital educational elements. We report the findings and define a set of recommendations from these results to help educators motivate their students and develop engaging digital educational content. Although our research is motivated by the pandemic, our findings and contributions are useful to all educators looking to establish some form of online learning. This includes developers of massive open online courses and teachers promoting blended learning in their classrooms.

            Towards a systematic approach to manual annotation of code smells

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are structures in code that indicate the presence of maintainability issues. A significant problem with code smells is their ambiguity. They are challenging to define, and software engineers have a different understanding of what a code smell is and which code suffers from code smells.
<br>A solution to this problem could be an AI digital assistant that understands code smells and can detect and even resolve them. However, it is challenging to develop such an assistant as there are few usable datasets of code smells on which to train and evaluate it. Furthermore, the existing datasets suffer from issues that mainly arise from an unsystematic approach used for their construction.
<br>Through this work, we address this issue by developing a procedure for the systematic manual annotation of code smells. We use this procedure to build a dataset of code smells. During this process, we refine the procedure and identify recommendations and risks for its use. The primary contribution is the proposed annotation model and procedure and the annotators’ experience report. The dataset and supporting tool are secondary contributions of our study. Notably, our dataset includes open-source projects written in the C# programming language, while almost all manually annotated datasets contain projects written in Java.

            Automatic detection of Long Method and God Class code smells through neural source code embeddings
          </h3>
          <p>
            <i>Kovačević, A., Slivka, J., Vidaković, D., Grujić, K.G., Luburić, N., Prokić, S., Sladić, G., 2021. Submitted to journal for consideration.</i>

            <b>Abstract</b>: Code smells are structures in code that often have a negative impact on its quality. Manually detecting code smells is challenging and researchers proposed many automatic code smell detectors. Most of the studies propose detectors based on code metrics and heuristics. However, these studies have several limitations, including evaluating the detectors using small-scale case studies and an inconsistent experimental setting. Furthermore, heuristic-based detectors suffer from limitations that hinder their adoption in practice. Thus, researchers have recently started experimenting with machine learning (ML) based code smell detection. 
<br>This paper compares the performance of multiple ML-based code smell detection models against multiple traditionally employed metric-based heuristics for detection of God Class and Long Method code smells. We evaluate the effectiveness of different source code representations for machine learning: traditionally used code metrics and code embeddings (code2vec, code2seq, and CuBERT).
<br>We perform our experiments on the large-scale, manually labeled MLCQ dataset. We consider the binary classification problem – we classify the code samples as smelly or non-smelly and use the F1-measure of the minority (smell) class as a measure of performance. In our experiments, the ML classifier trained using CuBERT source code embeddings achieved the best performance for both God Class (F-measure of 0.53) and Long Method detection (F-measure of 0.75). With the help of a domain expert, we perform the error analysis to discuss the advantages of the CuBERT approach.
<br>This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained neural source code embeddings for code smell detection to the best of our knowledge. A secondary contribution of our study is the systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of multiple heuristic-based approaches on the same large-scale, manually labeled MLCQ dataset.
