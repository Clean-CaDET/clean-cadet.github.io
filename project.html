            The Clean Code and Design Educational Tool (Clean CaDET) is a platform dedicated to the study of clean code. It presents a conglomerate of AI-powered tools for educators, learners, practitioners, and researchers studying clean code.
          </p>
          <p>
            We maintain <strong><a href="https://github.com/Clean-CaDET/platform#readme" target="_blank">an open-source repository</a></strong> that hosts our platform and it's ever-increasing set of capabilities.

            <b>Abstract</b>: Many different code snippets can implement the same software feature. However, a significant subset of these possible solutions contains difficult-to-understand code that harms the software’s maintainability and evolution. Such low-quality code snippets directly harm profit, as frequent and fast code change enables businesses to seize new opportunities. Unfortunately, they are also prevalent in an industry that consists mostly of junior programmers.<br>We developed a platform called Clean CaDET to tackle the prevalence of low-quality code from two angles. The Smell Detector module presents a framework for integrating AI-based code quality assessment algorithms to identify low-quality code as the programmer is writing it. The Smart Tutor module hosts a catalog of educational content that helps the programmer understand the identified issue and suggests possible solutions. By combining the quality assessment with the educational aspect, our integrated solution presents a novel approach for increasing the quality of code produced by our industry.
