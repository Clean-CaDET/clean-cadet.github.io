Code smells are structures in code that signal the need for refactoring to avoid 
degrading the software's quality attributes. Our project aims to develop a tool 
that automatically detects code smells, notifies the developer, and educates them
on the possible strategies for resolving the identified issues. There is a large
variety of cataloged code smells, and addressing all smell types is a challenging 
task due to their varied nature. Thus, we have analyzed the existing empirical
studies on code smells to determine each smell type-s prevalence and negative impact.
This analysis helped us select our first-priority target code smell types: 
**Good Class**, **Long Method**, and **Feature Envy**.  

Characteristics of each chosen target code smell, along with our key takeaways 
can be found [here](https://github.com/Clean-CaDET/Deliverables/blob/main/work_package_1/D1.1.%20Report%20on%20the%20selected%20target%20smells.pdf).
